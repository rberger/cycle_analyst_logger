# Cycle_analyst_logger

Log the streaming data log output of a Grin Cycle Analyst V3 and optionally a Phaserunner and GPS

[![Gem Version Badge](https://badge.fury.io/rb/cycle_analyst_logger.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/cycle_analyst_logger)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on
how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* Ruby ~2.4 or ~2.5
* Bundler

Bundler / Gemspec automatically pulls in all the dependencies

### Installing for doing development

The usual Ruby install from github

```
git clone git@github.com:rberger/phaserunner.git
cd phaserunner
bundle install
```

### Notes

* Delegates all Phaserunner operations to [rberger/phaserunner](https://github.com/rberger/phaserunner) [phaserunner ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/phaserunner)
* Only tested with [Navspark-BD GPS](http://navspark.mybigcommerce.com/navspark-bd-arduino-compatible-development-board-with-gps-beidou/)
* Now applies scaling factors to the Phaserunner data
* Log output file is CSV with CA, Phaserunner and GPS Data per line
* Also outputs the raw NMEA GPS file so that it can be read into [Grin Trip Analyzer](http://www.ebikes.ca/tools/trip-analyzer.html)
* The `to_ca_file` command  converts the default log output file to a CALog file suitable for inputing to [Grin Trip Analyzer](http://www.ebikes.ca/tools/trip-analyzer.html)
* Sometimes the Trip Analyzer barfs on the NMEA file

```
## Deployment

Deploy as usual. If you are not doing it from a git clone just want to install from Rubygems:

```
gem install phaserunner
```

### Udev set up

A sample udev rules file is in `resources/99-cycle_analyst.rules`. It is based on
the information from [Persistent names for usb-serial
devices](http://hintshop.ludvig.co.nz/show/persistent-names-usb-serial-devices/)

This one assumes we have the TTL to USB Cable based on the FTDI chipset like the
[USB Cables from Grin Tech](http://www.ebikes.ca/ca-usb.html) We have one for
the Cycle Analyst (CA) and one for the Phaserunner. If you always use the same
cable with the CA and the other cable always for the Phaserunner (Label them).
Then you can get away with using the serial numbers that the UDEV system sees to
automatically link whatever USB port the cable is plugged into to the right
`/dev` name.

The Navspark-BD GPS I used has a built in PL2303 chipset and doesn't seem to
have a serial number like the FTDI chipsets does. So the setup assumes there is
only one PL2303 USB and its the GPS.

### Systemd startup

There is a working systemd service unit file
`resources/cycle_analyst_logger.service`. You can copy it into
`/lib/systemd/system` and do a

`systemctl daemon-reload` to load it into systemd

* If you want it to start when the system is booted say:

  `systemctl enable cycle_analyst_logger.service`

* To disable:

  `systemctl disable cycle_analyst_logger.service`

* To start it manually (have to do this also the first time you do an enable and
  want it to run then):

  `systemctl start cycle_analyst_logger.service`

* You can check the status:

  `systemctl status cycle_analyst_logger.service`

* To see the logs:

  `journalctl -u cycle_analyst_logger.service`

This file assumed that rvm was installed in my home directory and an rvm wrapper
was created so it the service unit file could just exec it. I am currently using
Ruby 2.4.1.

The command used to create the wrapper was run as my normal user:

`rvm alias create cycle_analyst_logger 2.4.1`
